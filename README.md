Hi, my name is Agnilonda (Yannick) Pakou.

je suis developpeur web fullstack.

I develop in laravel (the framework for web artisans) and VueJs.

Passionate about technology, I have experienced an assertive 
career path that has for nearly two years highlighted the team 
spirit and interpersonal skills that sleep in me.

I am the lead or collaborator that your development teams need.
